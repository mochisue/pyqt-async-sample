# Usage

### Install

The following command will install the latest version of a module and its dependencies.

```
pip install git+https://github.com/mochisue/pyqt-async-sample.git
```

### Run GUI
The following command will launch the GUI application. You can also do the same by running the [sample.py](src/sample.py) program.

```
pyqtasync_gui
```

# Sample program

I have placed the Mac OS X application [here](https://github.com/mochisue/pyqt-async-sample/releases/download/v1.0/sample.zip), sorry, but it is not notarized.
This is created with [pyinstaller](https://github.com/pyinstaller/pyinstaller).

# Note

When it comes to progress bars in python, [tqdm](https://github.com/tqdm/tqdm) is famous, but this time I dared to use [progress](https://github.com/verigak/progress). The reason is that tqdm, pyqt, and pyinstaller are not compatible.
